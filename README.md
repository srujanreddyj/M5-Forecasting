# M5-Forecasting
---
For detailed EDA and visualization, my inference about the EDA, modelling, Prediction please visit my [BLOG](https://srujanreddyj.github.io/portfolio/2020/09/26/M5_1.html).

## Project Goal
* Learning and Applying data wrangling, data exploration and forecasting methods.
* Applying various forecasting methods and coming up with better predictions for 28-100 days for all the items in the data.
* Learn to tell a story and practice various data visualization techniques

## Data Source
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/m5-forecasting-accuracy)

## Data Description
* WALMART data from three states California, Texas, Wisconsin for three product Foods, household and hobbies.

## NOTEBOOKS

* For EDA - see [COLAB](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-CQfUBNaHa8o1QruIUUnNPN6lsH_9jlT?usp=sharing)

* [LightGBM](https://github.com/srujanreddyj/M5-Forecasting/blob/master/LIGHTGBM_forecasting.ipynb) - This notebook contains the implementation for Boosting technique LightGBM to forecast time-series models.

## Conclusion
* 9 different time-series were explore instead of 42000 time series
* Different forecasting methods have been experimented and explored. 
* RMSE metric returned about 1.5 - 2.5 for 9 time series models.

## Future Scoep
* Explore LSTM, Prophet
* Explore more time series, finding trend and seasonality between items in the products and combine them to explore more time-series
